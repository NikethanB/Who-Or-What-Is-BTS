    <p><h1>About This Song</h1></p>
    <p>"Save Me" (stylized as "Save ME") is a song by South Korean boy group BTS from their compilation album The Most Beautiful Moment In Life: Young Forever (2016). The original Korean version was released by Big Hit on May 2, 2016, in South Korea. The Japanese single version was released on September 7, 2016, on their album Youth,[1] under Universal Music Japan and Virgin Music-Def Jam Recordings.

        "Save Me" is a tropical house and electropop track. NME's Rhian Daly described it as "deceptively bright and bouncy – an aural carnival that masks the pleas for help in the lyrics."[2] The song opens with energetic synth sound that sonically develops towards tropical house sound.[3][4] The song contains a speedy rhythm and a "frenetic" chorus.[4] Billboard described it as "powerfully subtle".[3] Lyrically, it deals with the theme of salvation.[4] The song was written by Pdogg, Ray Michael Djan Jr, Ashton Foster, Samantha Harper, RM, Suga, and J-Hope with Pdogg serving as the primary producer.[5] Musically, it is in the key of D♭ major and is 140 beats per minute.[6]

        The music video for "Save Me", released in conjunction with the single was produced and directed by GDW.[7][8] The music video, which was notably filmed in a one-shot take[9] shows BTS members singing and performing intense choreography against the wind, in the backdrop of low-lying clouds that maximize the atmosphere and convey the emotions of a lyrically sad song.[10] The dance was choreographed by The Quick Style Crew.[11]

BTS decided to promote on music shows only for a week,[12] performing on Mnet, KBS, MBC and SBS as planned to allow for individual activities, performances and overseas schedules, starting with M! Countdown on May 12.[13] The song was promoted at the 2018 MBC Plus X Genie Music Awards performances as well.[14]

    <p><h1>Lyrics</h1></p>

    난 숨쉬고 싶어, 이 밤이 싫어 (이 밤이 싫어) <br>
이젠 깨고 싶어, 꿈속이 싫어 (꿈속이 싫어)<br>
내 안에 갇혀서, 난 죽어있어 (난 죽어있어)<br>
Don't wanna be lonely<br>
Just wanna be yours<br>
왜 이리 깜깜한 건지<br>
니가 없는 이 곳은?<br>
위험하잖아 망가진 내 모습<br>
구해줘 날 나도 날 잡을 수 없어 수없어<br>
내 심장소릴 들어봐<br>
제멋대로 널 부르잖아<br>
이 까만 어둠 속에서<br>
너는 이렇게 빛나니까<br>
그 손을 내밀어줘, save me, save me<br>
I need your love before I fall, fall (Fall)<br>
그 손을 내밀어줘, save me, save me<br>
I need your love before I fall, fall (Fall)<br>
그 손을 내밀어줘, save me, save me<br>
(Oh-oh, save me-me-me)<br>
그 손을 내밀어줘, save me, save me<br>
(Oh-oh, save me-me-me)<br>
Save me, save me<br>
(Oh-oh, save me-me-me)<br>
오늘따라 달이 빛나 (빛나) 내 기억 속의 빈칸 (빈칸)<br>
날 삼켜버린 이 lunatic<br>
Please save me tonight (Tonight)<br>
P-p-p-please save me tonight<br>
P-p-p-please save me tonight (Tonight)<br>
이 치기 어린 광기 속<br>
나를 구원해줄 이 밤<br>
난 알았지 (알았지) 너란 구원이<br>
내 삶의 일부며 아픔을<br>
감싸줄 유일한 손길<br>
The best of me (the best of me) 난 너밖에 없지 (Hey)<br>
나 다시 웃을 수 있도록 더 높여줘 니 목소릴 (Play on)<br>
내 심장소릴 들어봐<br>
제멋대로 널 부르잖아<br>
이 까만 어둠 속에서<br>
너는 이렇게 빛나니까<br>
그 손을 내밀어줘, save me, save me (Save me)<br>
I need your love before I fall, fall (Fall)<br>
I need your love before I fall, fall (Fall)<br>
그 손을 내밀어줘, save me, save me<br>
(Oh-oh, save me-me-me)<br>
그 손을 내밀어줘, save me, save me<br>
(Oh-oh, save me-me-me)<br>
고마워 내가 나이게 해줘<br>
이 내가 날게 해줘서<br>
이런 내게 날갤 줘서<br>
꼬깃하던 날 개 줘서<br>
답답하던 날 깨줘서<br>
꿈 속에만 살던 날 깨워줘서<br>
널 생각하면 날 개어서 (Yeah)<br>
슬픔 따윈 나 개 줬어<br>
Thank you, 우리가 돼 줘서<br>
그 손을 내밀어줘, save me, save me<br>
I need your love before I fall, fall (Fall)<br>
그 손을 내밀어줘, save me, save me<br>
I need your love before I fall, fall (Fall)<br>
