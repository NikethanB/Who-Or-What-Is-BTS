    되고파 너의 오빠 <br>
너의 사랑이 난 너무 고파<br>
되고파 너의 오빠<br>
널 갖고 말 거야 두고 봐<br>
왜 내 맘을 흔드는 건데<br>
왜 내 맘을 흔드는 건데<br>
왜 내 맘을 흔드는 건데<br>
흔드는 건데 흔드는 건데<br>
아빠, 아빤 대체 어떻게<br>
엄마한테 고백한 건지<br>
편지라도 써야 될런지<br>
뭔지, 니 앞에서 난 먼지<br>
괜히 틱틱대고 씩씩대고 징징대게 돼<br>
나는 진지한데 찌질하게 시비나 걸게 돼<br>
뭔데 신경 쓰여<br>
다 큰 날 애로 만들어<br>
거꾸로 뒤집을껴, 인연을 연인으로<br>
대학까지도 너랑 간다면 참 잘 갈 것 같아<br>
Oh 가나다라마바사아 하쿠나마타타!<br>
Oh 똑같은 프로필 사진 왜 자꾸 확인할까<br>
Oh 그렇다고 착각하지마 쉬운 남자 아냐<br>
안달 났어 나 안달 났어<br>
니가 뭔데? 너만 잘났어?<br>
왜 나를 자꾸 놀려 놀려<br>
너 이제 그만 hol' up hol' up<br>
꽉 잡아 날 덮치기 전에<br>
내 맘이 널 놓치기 전에<br>
Say what you want<br>
Say what you want<br>
니가 진짜로 원하는 게 뭐야<br>
꽉 잡아 날 덮치기 전에<br>
내 맘이 널 놓치기 전에<br>
Say what you want<br>
Say what you want<br>
니가 진짜로 원하는 게 뭐야<br>
왜 내 맘을 흔드는 건데<br>
왜 내 맘을 흔드는 건데<br>
왜 내 맘을 흔드는 건데<br>
흔드는 건데 흔드는 건데<br>
겉으론 bad bad girl, 속은 더 bad bad girl<br>
나 같은 남잘 놓치면 후회하게 될 걸<br>
메신저 확인해놓고 누르지 않는 너의 행위<br>
"1" 자리 없어 짐과 동시에 속만 타지 네비<br>
게이션이나 살까 봐 (빠름 빠름 빠름)<br>
어필하려고 계속 난 (아둥 바둥 바둥)<br>
진심? (I got 'em) 뒷심? (I got 'em)<br>
내가 유일하게 갖지 못한 건 너의 (아름 아름 다움)<br>
이 내가 어떻게 변하면 되겠니, hol' up<br>
밀당? 어장? 그런 거 난 잘 몰러<br>
대신 아프면 119 말고 날 불러<br>
니가 울라면 울어, 웃으라면 웃어, 구르라면 굴러<br>
안달 났어 나 안달 났어<br>
니가 뭔데? 너만 잘났어?<br>
왜 나를 자꾸 놀려 놀려<br>
너 이제 그만 hol' up hol' up<br>
꽉 잡아 날 덮치기 전에<br>
내 맘이 널 놓치기 전에<br>
Say what you want<br>
Say what you want<br>
니가 진짜로 원하는 게 뭐야<br>
꽉 잡아 날 덮치기 전에<br>
내 맘이 널 놓치기 전에<br>
Say what you want<br>
Say what you want<br>
니가 진짜로 원하는 게 뭐야<br>
되고파 너의 오빠<br>
너를 향한 나의 마음을 왜 몰라<br>
나를 모른 척해도 차가운 척해도<br>
널 밀어내진 못하겠어<br>
되고파 너의 오빠<br>
너의 남자가 될 거야 두고 봐<br>
나의 마음이 네게 닿도록<br>
지금 달려갈 거야<br>
꽉 잡아 날 덮치기 전에<br>
내 맘이 널 놓치기 전에<br>
Say what you want<br>
Say what you want<br>
니가 진짜로 원하는 게 뭐야<br>
꽉 잡아 날 덮치기 전에<br>
내 맘이 널 놓치기 전에<br>
Say what you want<br>
Say what you want<br>
니가 진짜로 원하는 게 뭐야<br>
