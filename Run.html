    <p>
        "Run" is a song recorded by South Korean boy band BTS as the lead single for their fourth extended play, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2 (2015). The original Korean version was released by Big Hit Entertainment on November 30, 2015 in South Korea. The Japanese single version was released on March 15, 2016 under the Pony Canyon label.
        “Run” has been described as a rock-dance song with lyrics about continuing to get up and run, even if obstacles continue to knock you down.[1] The song is composed in the key of F# minor at a tempo of 133 beats per minute.[2]
        The teaser for the Korean version of the song was released by Big Hit Entertainment November 24, 2015, and the music video was released on November 30, 2015, in South Korea.[3]

Both versions of the music video were directed by Choi YongSeok from Lumpens with Ko Yoojung, Lee Wonju, Ko Hyunji, and Jung Noori serving as assistant directors.

The Korean version of the song was not released as a separate single. Two official remixes of the track were later released in May 2016 on The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever compilation album.[5]

    <p><h1>Lyrics</h1></p>

    넌 내 하나뿐인 태양 세상에 딱 하나<br>
널 향해 피었지만 난 자꾸 목말라<br>
너무 늦었어 늦었어 너 없이 살 순 없어<br>
가지가 말라도 더 힘껏 손을 뻗어<br>

손 뻗어봤자 금세<br>
깨버릴 꿈 꿈 꿈<br>
미칠 듯 달려도<br>
또 제자리일 뿐 뿐 뿐<br>
그냥 날 태워줘 그래 더 밀쳐내줘<br>
이건 사랑에 미친 멍청이의 뜀박질<br>

더 뛰게 해줘<br>
나를 더 뛰게 해줘<br>
두 발에 상처만 가득해도<br>
니 얼굴만 보면 웃는 나니까<br>

다시 run run run 난 멈출 수가 없어<br>
또 run run run 난 어쩔 수가 없어<br>
어차피 이것밖에 난 못해<br>
너를 사랑하는 것 밖엔 못해<br>

다시 run run run 넘어져도 괜찮아<br>
또 run run run 좀 다쳐도 괜찮아<br>
가질 수 없다 해도 난 족해<br>
바보 같은 운명아 나를 욕해<br>

(Run)<br>
Don't tell me bye bye<br>
(Run)<br>
You make me cry cry<br>
(Run)<br>
Love is a lie lie<br>
Don't tell me, don't tell me<br>
Don't tell me bye bye<br>

다 끝난 거라는데 난 멈출 수가 없네<br>
땀인지 눈물인지 나 더는 분간 못해 oh<br>
내 발가벗은 사랑도 거친 태풍 바람도<br>
나를 더 뛰게만 해 내 심장과 함께<br>

더 뛰게 해줘<br>
나를 더 뛰게 해줘<br>
두 발에 상처만 가득해도<br>
니 얼굴만 보면 웃는 나니까<br>

다시 run run run 난 멈출 수가 없어<br>
또 run run run 난 어쩔 수가 없어<br>
어차피 이것밖에 난 못해<br>
너를 사랑하는 것 밖엔 못해<br>

다시 run run run 넘어져도 괜찮아<br>
또 run run run 좀 다쳐도 괜찮아<br>
가질 수 없다 해도 난 족해<br>
바보 같은 운명아 나를 욕해<br>

추억들이 마른 꽃잎처럼<br>
산산이 부서져가<br>
내 손 끝에서 내 발 밑에서<br>
달려가는 네 등 뒤로<br>
마치 나비를 쫓듯 꿈 속을 헤매듯<br>
너의 흔적을 따라가<br>
길을 알려줘 날 좀 멈춰줘<br>
날 숨쉬게 해줘<br>

다시 run run run 난 멈출 수가 없어<br>
또 run run run 난 어쩔 수가 없어<br>
어차피 이것밖에 난 못해<br>
너를 사랑하는 것 밖엔 못해<br>

다시 run run run 넘어져도 괜찮아<br>
또 run run run 좀 다쳐도 괜찮아<br>
가질 수 없다 해도 난 족해<br>
바보 같은 운명아 나를 욕해<br>

(Run)<br>
Don't tell me bye bye<br>
(Run)<br>
You make me cry cry<br>
(Run)<br>
Love is a lie lie<br>
Don't tell me, don't tell me<br>
Don't tell me bye bye<br>
